# The front end GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database implemented in SQLite.
It should contain buttons to perform the following operations on the ‘books’ database:

 

#display all the records
#search a book
#add a book
#issue a book
#delete a book
#exit the application
 

When option 1 is selected, all the books present in the library should be displayed. Option 2 should be able to search the book based on any of the criteria like author name, book title, year or ISBN. Similarly, it should be able to add the entry when option 3 is selected and issue a book when option 4 is selected. The book details should be deleted when option 5 is selected. Selecting option 6 should provide a graceful exit from the app.
